# Lecture-Learn-App
This application was designed based on assessment criteria, the purpose being to provide a booking system for a educational organisation to book lecture halls or labs for their lectures.
The app was developed and testing using Java and utilises Object Orientated Programming(OOP) and a Graphical User Interface through the Java Swing framework. 

The project consisted of designing the user interfaces through storyboards and wireframes, developing the frontend designs and backend logic in Java (including invalid data entry or error handling), creating documentation such as UML diagrams for the project then finally running unit tests on all functions and class methods, resulting in a completed application.
